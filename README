== clj-stripe

clj-stripe is a library that provides Clojure bindings for the Stripe API.

== Usage

clj-stripe wraps around the Stripe REST API. For a detailed explanation of the available operations and parameters visit https://stripe.com/api/docs .

The general way of invoking operation is:

* To execute an operation, first create it using the appropriate funcion. For example, to create an operation for retrieving a customer, just execute
(customers/get-customer "mycustomerid")
That will return a map that represents the action of retrieving that customer.
* Some operations require parameters that are provided through other functions. For example, the function customers/get-customers (that retrieves all customers) accepts two optional parameters, count and offset. To create that operation you must use auxiliary functions defined in the common namespace:
(customers/get-customers (common/limit-count 10) (common/offset 4))
or, for brevity,
(customers/get-customers (common/position 10 4))
* Once created, execute an operation by passing it as parameter to the common/execute multimethod.
* Wrap all the calls to execute in a call to common/with-token. That will provide the authentication token needed when invoking the Stripe API.
